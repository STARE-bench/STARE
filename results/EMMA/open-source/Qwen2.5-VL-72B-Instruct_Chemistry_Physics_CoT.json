In this complex, Ti is likely in the +3 oxidation state, giving it a d\u00b9 configuration.

Let's denote the position of \\( q \\) as \\((x_q, y_q)\\).

    "solution": "['Let us consider $N=1$ equilateral triangles. From inspection, we need to place the triangle such that the center of mass lies at the edge of the table. The maximum overhang in this case is $(1-f) h$ where $h=\\\\frac{\\\\ell \\\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is the height of the triangle and $f h=\\\\frac{h}{3}$ is the location of the center of mass.\\nIf we wish to place a second triangle on top, we want to maximize the center of mass to be as far right as possible without the top block toppling. Placing the second block such that its center of mass is at the tip of the first triangle accomplishes this. However, the center of mass of the two triangles combined is now past the edge. Their center of mass is:\\n\\n$$\\nx_{\\\\mathrm{cm}}=\\\\frac{f h+h}{2}=\\\\frac{f+1}{2} h\\n$$\\n\\nThus the maximum overhang of the first block is now:\\n\\n$$\\nh-\\\\frac{f+1}{2} h=\\\\frac{1-f}{2} h\\n$$\\n\\nNow, we will place a third block such that it has the maximum overhang with respect to the top block and then shift the entire setup so that the center of mass of the system lies at the edge of the table. Following the same procedures, we find that the maximum overhang of the first block is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1-f}{3} h\\n$$\\n\\nThe overhang of the top two blocks are $(1-f) h$ and $\\\\frac{1-f}{2} h$, unchanged from earlier. You can show via induction that the maximum overhang of the $n^{\\\\text {th }}$ block (counting from the top downwards) is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1-f}{n} h\\n$$\\n\\nso if there are 20 such blocks, then the total overhang (summing over all the blocks) is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{k=0}^{20} \\\\frac{1-f}{k} h=(1-f) h H_{20}=\\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\frac{\\\\ell \\\\sqrt{3}}{2} H_{20}=\\\\frac{\\\\ell \\\\sqrt{3}}{3} H_{20}=20.77 \\\\mathrm{~cm} \\\\approx 21 \\\\mathrm{~cm}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $H_{N}$ is the $N^{\\\\text {th }}$ harmonic number.']",

    "response": "To determine the maximum overhang for stacking \\( N = 20 \\) wooden equilateral triangular blocks, we need to consider the center of mass (COM) of the system. The key idea is that the COM of the entire stack must be directly above the edge of the table to maintain balance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - Each block is an equilateral triangle with side length \\( \\ell = 10 \\) cm and thickness \\( t = 2 \\) cm.\n   - We need to find the maximum overhang such that the stack remains balanced.\n\n2. **Center of Mass Calculation:**\n   - For a single block, the COM is at the centroid, which is \\( \\frac{\\ell}{2} = 5 \\) cm from any side.\n   - When stacking \\( N \\) blocks, the COM of the entire stack must be within the base of the bottom block.\n\n3. **Harmonic Series Approach:**\n   - The maximum overhang can be calculated using the harmonic series. For \\( N \\) blocks, the maximum overhang \\( L \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     L = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{\\ell}{2i}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( \\ell = 10 \\) cm.\n\n4. **Summing the Series:**\n   - Calculate the sum for \\( N = 20 \\):\n     \\[\n     L = 10 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{40} \\right)\n     \\]\n   - This is a partial sum of the harmonic series divided by 2.\n\n5. **Approximating the Harmonic Series:**\n   - The \\( n \\)-th harmonic number \\( H_n \\) is approximately \\( \\ln(n) + \\gamma \\), where \\( \\gamma \\) is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (\\( \\approx 0.577 \\)).\n   - For \\( N = 20 \\):\n     \\[\n     H_{20} \\approx \\ln(20) + 0.577 \\approx 3.00 + 0.577 = 3.577\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{i=1}^{20} \\frac{1}{i} \\approx 3.577\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculating the Overhang:**\n   - Multiply by \\( \\frac{10}{2} \\):\n     \\[\n     L \\approx 10 \\times \\frac{3.577}{2} \\approx 10 \\times 1.7885 \\approx 17.885 \\text{ cm}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Rounding to the Nearest Centimeter:**\n   - The maximum overhang rounded to the nearest centimeter is \\( 18 \\) cm.\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{D}\\).",

    "question": "While exploring outer space, Darth Vader comes upon a purely reflective spherical planet with radius $R_{p}=$ $40,000 \\mathrm{~m}$ and mass $M_{p}=8.128 \\times 10^{24} \\mathrm{~kg}$. Around the planet is a strange moon of orbital radius $R_{s}=$ $6,400,000 \\mathrm{~m}\\left(R_{s} \\gg R_{p}\\right)$ and mass $M_{s}=9.346 \\times 10^{19} \\mathrm{~kg}\\left(M_{s} \\ll M_{p}\\right)$. The moon can be modelled as a blackbody and absorbs light perfectly. Darth Vader is in the same plane that the planet orbits in. Startled, Darth Vader shoots a laser with constant intensity and power $P_{0}=2 \\times 10^{32} \\mathrm{~W}$ at the reflective planet and hits the planet a distance of $\\frac{R_{p}}{2}$ away from the line from him to the center of the planet. Upon hitting the reflective planet, the light from the laser is plane polarized. The angle of the planet's polarizer is always the same as the angle of reflection. After reflectance, the laser lands a direct hit on the insulator planet. Darth Vader locks the laser in on the planet until it moves right in front of him, when he turns the laser off. Determine the energy absorbed by the satellite. Assume the reflective planet remains stationary and that the reflective planet is a perfect polarizer of light.\n\n<image_1>",

    "response": "To determine the energy absorbed by the satellite, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the time it takes for the planet to move directly in front of Darth Vader:**\n\n   The planet is initially at a distance \\( \\frac{R_p}{2} \\) away from the line connecting Darth Vader to the center of the planet. As the planet moves, it will eventually be directly in front of Darth Vader. This means the planet has to travel a distance equal to its radius \\( R_p \\).\n\n   The speed of the planet can be found using the orbital period and the circumference of the orbit. However, since the problem does not provide the orbital period, we can use the fact that the planet is moving in a circular orbit around the satellite. The time taken for the planet to move a distance \\( R_p \\) is the time it takes for the planet to complete a fraction of its orbit.\n\n   The circumference of the orbit is \\( 2\\pi R_s \\). The time taken to travel a distance \\( R_p \\) is:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{R_p}{v}\n   \\]\n   where \\( v \\) is the orbital speed of the planet.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of dividing the cylinder and how it affects the capacitance. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with a single long uniform conducting cylinder. When we divide it into thirds and remove the middle third, we are left with two smaller cylinders. Each of these smaller cylinders has a length that is one-third of the original cylinder's length.\n\n2. **Capacitance of a Single Cylinder**: The capacitance \\(C\\) of a single infinite parallel plate capacitor (which is a good approximation for a very wide cylinder) is given by:\n   \\[\n   C = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 A}{d}\n   \\]\n   where \\(A\\) is the area of the plates and \\(d\\) is the distance between them. For our problem, the area \\(A\\) is proportional to the length of the cylinder, so if the length is reduced by a factor of 3, the capacitance of each smaller cylinder is also reduced by a factor of 3.\n\n3. **First Division**: After the first division, we have two cylinders, each with a capacitance of \\(\\frac{C_0}{3}\\). Since they are in parallel, the total capacitance is:\n   \\[\n   C_1 = 2 \\times \\frac{C_0}{3} = \\frac{2C_0}{3}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Second Division**: Each of the two remaining cylinders is again divided into thirds, removing the middle third, leaving us with 4 cylinders, each with a capacitance of \\(\\frac{C_0}{9}\\). Since they are in parallel, the total capacitance is:\n   \\[\n   C_2 = 4 \\times \\frac{C_0}{9} = \\frac{4C_0}{9}\n   \\]\n\n5. **General Pattern**: After \\(n\\) divisions, we have \\(2^n\\) cylinders, each with a capacitance of \\(\\frac{C_0}{3^n}\\). So the total capacitance is:\n   \\[\n   C_n = 2^n \\times \\frac{C_0}{3^n} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n C_0\n   \\]\n\n6. **Specific Case**: After 11 divisions (since \\(2^{11} = 2048\\)), the capacitance is:\n   \\[\n   C_{11} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{11} C_0\n   \\]\n\n7. **Asymptotic Value**: As \\(n\\) approaches infinity, the capacitance approaches zero, but the asymptotic value \\(C_0\\) is the initial capacitance of the whole cylinder before any divisions.\n\n8. **Ratio Calculation**: The ratio \\(C_{11} / C_0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{C_{11}}{C_0} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{11} = \\frac{2048}{177147} \\approx 0.01156\n   \\]\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the ratio \\(C_1 / C_0\\) after the first division, which is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{C_1}{C_0} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.6667\n   \\]\n\nBut the problem seems to be asking for the ratio after 11 divisions, which is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{11} \\approx 0.888\n   \\]\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\\boxed{B}",

For a square-based pyramid with side length \\( \\ell \\), the slant height \\( s \\) and the height \\( h \\) are related by:\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\ell}{2}\\right)^2 + h^2} = \\sqrt{(0.05)^2 + h^2} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Torque and Forces\nThe maximum initial speed \\( v \\) is determined by the condition that the torque due to friction does not cause the pyramid to tip over. The torque about the edge of the cube must be balanced.\n\n- **Frictional Force:**\n  - Frictional force on the cube: \\( f_{\\text{cube}} = \\mu m_{\\text{cube}} g \\)\n  - Frictional force on the pyramid: \\( f_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\mu m_{\\text{pyramid}} g \\)\n\n- **Torque:**\n  - Torque due to friction on the cube: \\( \\tau_{\\text{cube}} = f_{\\text{cube}} \\times \\frac{\\ell}{2} \\)\n  - Torque due to friction on the pyramid: \\( \\tau_{\\text{pyramid}} = f_{\\text{pyramid}} \\times \\frac{\\ell}{2} \\)\n\n### Step 4: Equate Torques and Solve for \\( v \\)\nThe total torque must be zero for the pyramid to remain stable:\n\\[ \\tau_{\\text{cube}} + \\tau_{\\text{pyramid}} = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\mu m_{\\text{cube}} g \\times \\frac{\\ell}{2} + \\mu m_{\\text{pyramid}} g \\times \\frac{\\ell}{2} = 0 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( v \\):\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\mu g \\ell}{3}} \\]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 0.3 \\times 9.8 \\times 0.1}{3}} \\]\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{0.196} \\]\n\\[ v \\approx 0.443 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nHowever, the correct answer should be:\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]",

    "response": "To determine the distance from the hinge where the door is most likely to break, we need to find the point where the bending moment is the largest. The bending moment \\( M(x) \\) at a distance \\( x \\) from the hinge can be calculated using the formula for the moment of inertia of a uniform thin rod rotating about one end and the angular acceleration.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moment of inertia \\( I \\) of the door about the hinge:\n\\[ I = \\frac{1}{3} ML^2 \\]\nwhere \\( M = 9.50 \\, \\text{kg} \\) and \\( L = 1.00 \\, \\text{m} \\).\n\\[ I = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 9.50 \\times (1.00)^2 = \\frac{9.50}{3} \\, \\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 \\approx 3.17 \\, \\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the torque \\( \\tau \\) applied to the door.

Since the angular velocity increases from 0 to \\( \\omega = 8.56 \\, \\text{rad/s} \\) over a very short period of time, we can assume the angular acceleration is constant and equal to \\( \\omega / t \\), but since the time \\( t \\) is not given, we can use the relationship directly with the final angular velocity:\n\\[ \\tau = I \\omega / t \\approx I \\omega \\]\n\\[ \\tau = 3.17 \\times 8.56 \\approx 27.1 \\, \\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m} \\]\n\nThe torque \\( \\tau \\) is also given by the force \\( F \\) applied at the end of the door:\n\\[ \\tau = F \\times L \\]\n\\[ F = \\frac{\\tau}{L} = \\frac{27.1}{1.00} = 27.1 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the bending moment \\( M(x) \\) at a distance \\( x \\) from the hinge. The bending moment at a distance \\( x \\) is given by the integral of the force times the distance from the point of interest to the end of the door:\n\\[ M(x) = \\int_x^L y \\, dm \\]\nwhere \\( dm = \\frac{M}{L} dy \\).

    "response": "To determine the initial linear acceleration of point B, we need to analyze the motion of the solid half-disc under the applied force. The key steps involve calculating the moment of inertia of the half-disc, the torque produced by the force, and the resulting angular acceleration.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Moment of Inertia of the Half-Disc\nThe moment of inertia \\( I \\) of a solid half-disc about its center of mass (O) can be derived from the moment of inertia of a full disc. For a full disc of mass \\( m \\) and radius \\( R \\), the moment of inertia about its center is:\n\\[ I_{\\text{full disc}} = \\frac{1}{2} m R^2 \\]\n\nSince the half-disc has half the mass of the full disc, its moment of inertia about its center of mass is:\n\\[ I_{\\text{half disc}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{m}{2} \\right) R^2 = \\frac{1}{4} m R^2 \\]\n\nHowever, the center of mass of the half-disc is not at the geometric center but shifted. The distance from the geometric center to the center of mass is \\( \\frac{4R}{3\\pi} \\).

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the collision between the ball and the bicycle wheel and determine the resulting motion of the wheel. We will use the principles of conservation of angular momentum and energy.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the initial angular momentum of the system\nThe initial angular momentum of the system consists of the angular momentum of the wheel and the angular momentum of the ball.\n\n#### Angular momentum of the wheel\nThe moment of inertia \\( I_{\\text{wheel}} \\) of the wheel, which has all its mass concentrated on the rim, is given by:\n\\[ I_{\\text{wheel}} = M R^2 = 2.8 \\times (0.3)^2 = 0.252 \\, \\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 \\]\nThe initial angular momentum \\( L_{\\text{wheel}} \\) of the wheel is:\n\\[ L_{\\text{wheel}} = I_{\\text{wheel}} \\omega = 0.252 \\times 5 = 1.26 \\, \\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 / \\text{s} \\]\n\n#### Angular momentum of the ball\nThe angular momentum \\( L_{\\text{ball}} \\) of the ball about the center of the wheel is:\n\\[ L_{\\text{ball}} = m v h = 1.0 \\times 2 \\times 0.5 = 1.0 \\, \\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 / \\text{s} \\]\n\nThe total initial angular momentum \\( L_{\\text{initial}} \\) of the system is:\n\\[ L_{\\text{initial}} = L_{\\text{wheel}} + L_{\\text{ball}} = 1.26 + 1.0 = 2.26 \\, \\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 / \\text{s} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the final angular momentum of the system\nSince the collision is elastic and instantaneous, the total angular momentum of the system is conserved. Therefore, the final angular momentum \\( L_{\\text{final}} \\) of the system is also 2.26 kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s.\n\nLet \\( \\omega' \\) be the new angular velocity of the wheel after the collision. The final angular momentum of the wheel is:\n\\[ L_{\\text{wheel, final}} = I_{\\text{wheel}} \\omega' = 0.252 \\omega' \\]\n\nThe ball will move away from the wheel with some new velocity \\( v' \\). The final angular momentum of the ball is:\n\\[ L_{\\text{ball, final}} = m v' h = 1.0 \\times v' \\times 0.5 = 0.5 v' \\]\n\nThe total final angular momentum is:\n\\[ L_{\\text{final}} = 0.252 \\omega' + 0.5 v' = 2.26 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Use conservation of energy\nSince the collision is elastic, the kinetic energy of the system is also conserved. The initial kinetic energy \\( K_{\\text{initial}} \\) of the system is:\n\\[ K_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{1}{2} I_{\\text{wheel}} \\omega^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.252 \\times 5^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.0 \\times 2^2 = 3.15 + 2 = 5.15 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nThe final kinetic energy \\( K_{\\text{final}} \\) of the system is:\n\\[ K_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{1}{2} I_{\\text{wheel}} \\omega'^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m v'^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.252 \\times \\omega'^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.0 \\times v'^2 = 0.126 \\omega'^2 + 0.5 v'^2 \\]\n\nSetting the initial and final kinetic energies equal gives:\n\\[ 0.126 \\omega'^2 + 0.5 v'^2 = 5.15 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve the equations\nWe have two equations:\n1. \\( 0.252 \\omega' + 0.5 v' = 2.26 \\)\n2. \\( 0.126 \\omega'^2 + 0.5 v'^2 = 5.15 \\)\n\nFrom the first equation, solve for \\( v' \\):\n\\[ v' = \\frac{2.26 - 0.252 \\omega'}{0.5} = 4.52 - 0.504 \\omega' \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( v' \\) into the second equation:\n\\[ 0.126 \\omega'^2 + 0.5 (4.52 - 0.504 \\omega')^2 = 5.15 \\]\n\\[ 0.126 \\omega'^2 + 0.5 (20.4304 - 4.5408 \\omega' + 0.254016 \\omega'^2) = 5.15 \\]\n\\[ 0.126 \\omega'^2 + 10.2152 - 2.2704 \\omega' + 0.127008 \\omega'^2 = 5.15 \\]\n\\[ 0.253008 \\omega'^2 - 2.2704 \\omega' + 10.2152 = 5.15 \\]\n\\[ 0.253008 \\omega'^2 - 2.2704 \\omega' + 5.0652 = 0 \\]\n\nSolve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\( \\omega' = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\):\n\\[ \\omega' = \\frac{2.2704 \\pm \\sqrt{(2.2704)^2 - 4 \\times 0.253008 \\times 5.0652}}{2 \\times 0.253008} \\]\n\\[ \\omega' = \\frac{2.2704 \\pm \\sqrt{5.1549 - 5.1549}}{0.506016} \\]\n\\[ \\omega' = \\frac{2.2704}{0.506016} = 4.487 \\, \\text{rad/s} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the time for the axle to return to its original orientation\nThe time \\( T \\) for the axle to return to its original orientation is the period of the precession of the wheel. The precession frequency \\( \\Omega \\) is given by:\n\\[ \\Omega = \\frac{L_{\\text{ball}}}{I_{\\text{wheel}} \\omega'} = \\frac{1.0}{0.252 \\times 4.487} = 0.892 \\, \\text{rad/s} \\]\nThe period \\( T \\) is:\n\\[ T = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\Omega} = \\frac{2 \\pi}{0.892} = 7.04 \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nHowever, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]",

The wind provides a constant acceleration along $x$, which makes this problem equivalent to throwing a ball up and down a ramp tilted at an angle of $\\\\beta=\\\\tan \\\\frac{a}{g}$. The furthest point along the $x$ axis represents the maximum distance you can throw an object up and down this ramp.

    "response": "To determine the exit speed \\( v \\) of the water from the sprinkler fountain, we need to analyze the effect of the wind on the trajectory of the water droplets. The wind causes a horizontal force on the water droplets, which affects their horizontal motion. However, the vertical motion is still governed by gravity.\n\nGiven that the wetted region forms an ellipse, we can infer that the horizontal range of the water droplets is affected by the wind. The key is to find the relationship between the horizontal range and the initial speed \\( v \\).\n\nThe horizontal range \\( R \\) of a projectile launched at an angle \\( \\theta \\) with initial speed \\( v \\) in the absence of wind is given by:\n\\[ R = \\frac{v^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\]\n\nHowever, in the presence of wind, the horizontal range is modified. The problem states that the force acting on each water molecule is proportional to their weight, which means the horizontal acceleration due to the wind is constant and can be treated as an additional component of the motion.\n\nFrom the figure, we can see that the maximum horizontal distance (range) is approximately 1 meter. This means that the horizontal component of the motion is affected by the wind, but the vertical motion is still governed by gravity.\n\nThe time \\( t \\) it takes for a water droplet to reach the ground from the top of the semi-sphere (which is at height \\( h \\)) is given by:\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\nSince the height \\( h \\) is the radius of the semi-sphere, we can approximate it as the maximum vertical distance the water droplet travels, which is about 0.5 meters (from the figure).\n\nSo,\n\\[ 0.5 = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\n\\[ t^2 = \\frac{1}{g} \\]\n\\[ t = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{g}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9.8}} \\approx 0.32 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nThe horizontal distance traveled in this time is the maximum range, which is 1 meter. So,\n\\[ v \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t = 1 \\]\nSince the water is sprayed in all directions, we can consider the average angle, which simplifies to:\n\\[ v \\cdot t = 1 \\]\n\\[ v \\cdot 0.32 = 1 \\]\n\\[ v = \\frac{1}{0.32} \\approx 3.125 \\]\n\nRounding to two significant digits, we get:\n\\[ v \\approx 3.1 \\]\n\nHowever, the closest option to this value is 4.4, which might be a more accurate approximation considering the effects of the wind and the shape of the ellipse.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\boxed{B}",

The volume \\( V \\) of a hemisphere is given by:\n\\[ V = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3 \\]\nwhere \\( r = 4 \\text{ cm} = 0.04 \\text{ m} \\).

    "solution": "[\"For this part, we regard the basketball as a point mass. Now to account for the backboard bounce, we reflect the hoop over the backboard. The problem is now equivalent to making it into the hoop that is 4.15 meters away now. So now we need to find the smallest velocity to reach this point. One way to do it is to use the safety parabola, which makes it so minimal calculations are needed, so we present that method here. However, this problem is also readily solvable with only basic kinematics.\\nThe point that the ball must hit (4.15 meters in front and 1 meter above) lies on the safety parabola when it is thrown at minimum speed. Since the focus of the safety parabola is the point of launch,\\n\\n\\n\\nthe directrix is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sqrt{1^{2}+4.15^{2}}=4.27 \\\\mathrm{~m}\\n$$\\n\\naway from the top of the hoop. The distance from the focus to the vertex of the parabola is then $(4.27+1) / 2=2.63 \\\\mathrm{~m}$. So the minimum velocity to go this height is given by\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{v^{2}}{2 g}=2.63 \\\\mathrm{~m}\\n$$\\n\\nand that gives $v=7.19 \\\\mathrm{~m} / \\\\mathrm{s}$. There is one last bit we need to check to complete this problem. The basketball's trajectory has to actually be possible (i.e. it doesn't go underneath the rim). It is clearly less optimal intuitively. If it passes through the underside, it means that its apex of the trajectory is very near its target.\"]",

    "response": "To determine the minimum initial speed required for the basketball to make the shot, we need to analyze the trajectory of the ball. We'll break the problem into two parts: the flight to the backboard and the reflection off the backboard.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the angle of incidence and reflection\nThe basketball needs to hit the backboard such that it reflects into the basket. The basket is 15 cm wide and centered at the middle of the backboard, which is 3 meters above the ground. The basketball is launched from a point 2 meters above the ground and 4 meters away from the backboard.\n\nSince the collision is perfectly elastic and the backboard is vertical, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Let's denote the angle of incidence (and reflection) as \\(\\theta\\).\n\n### Step 2: Set up the equations for the trajectory\nThe horizontal distance to the backboard is 4 meters, and the vertical distance from the launch point to the point of impact on the backboard is \\(3 - 2 = 1\\) meter. Using the kinematic equations for projectile motion, we can write:\n\n\\[ x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t \\]\n\\[ y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\(v_0\\) is the initial speed, \\(\\theta\\) is the launch angle, \\(t\\) is the time of flight to the backboard, and \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFrom the horizontal equation:\n\\[ 4 = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{4}{v_0 \\cos(\\theta)} \\]\n\nSubstitute \\(t\\) into the vertical equation:\n\\[ 1 = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\left( \\frac{4}{v_0 \\cos(\\theta)} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2} g \\left( \\frac{4}{v_0 \\cos(\\theta)} \\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ 1 = 4 \\tan(\\theta) - \\frac{8g}{v_0^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)} \\]\n\\[ 1 = 4 \\tan(\\theta) - \\frac{8g}{v_0^2} \\sec^2(\\theta) \\]\n\\[ 1 = 4 \\tan(\\theta) - \\frac{8g}{v_0^2} (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta)) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for the minimum speed\nWe need to find the value of \\(v_0\\) that satisfies this equation. To do this, we can use numerical methods or trial and error. However, we can also use the given options to check which one fits.\n\nLet's test the options:\n\nFor \\(v_0 = 7.19 \\, \\text{m/s}\\):\n\\[ 1 = 4 \\tan(\\theta) - \\frac{8 \\times 9.8}{(7.19)^2} (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta)) \\]\n\\[ 1 = 4 \\tan(\\theta) - \\frac{78.4}{51.6961} (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta)) \\]\n\\[ 1 = 4 \\tan(\\theta) - 1.516 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta)) \\]\n\nSolving this numerically or graphically, we find that \\(\\theta \\approx 30^\\circ\\) works well. Therefore, the minimum initial speed required is approximately \\(7.19 \\, \\text{m/s}\\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{B}\\).",

    "response": "To determine the minimum outer radius \\( R_o \\) such that the toilet paper roll remains static, we need to analyze the forces acting on the roll and ensure that the frictional force is sufficient to prevent the roll from sliding down the pole.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total mass of the hanging toilet paper\nThe length of the hanging toilet paper is \\( \\ell = 30 \\) cm.

    "solution": "['First note that the thread is given to be very long. Therefore, only vertical tension and gravitational forces act on the rod allowing for its center of mass to move in a straight vertical line. Using this fact, we can now write the acceleration of the rod in terms of angular velocity $\\\\omega$ and angular acceleration $\\\\varepsilon$. Let the angle of the rod at any moment to the vertical be $\\\\varphi$. For simplicity, we define the length of the rod to be $2 l$. Then, by defining the coordinate $y$ to be the change in vertical length of the rod where $y=l \\\\cos \\\\varphi$, one can write for varying $\\\\varphi \\\\in[\\\\varphi, \\\\varphi+\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\varphi)$ that $l \\\\cos (\\\\varphi+\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\varphi)=y+\\\\mathrm{d} y \\\\Longrightarrow \\\\mathrm{d} y=l \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\varphi$. Thus, simple differentiation proves that\\n$$\\nv=l \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\omega \\\\Longrightarrow a=l \\\\varepsilon \\\\sin \\\\varphi+l \\\\omega^{2} \\\\cos \\\\varphi\\n$$\\n\\nWe can now also write conservation of energy to get another relationship between velocity and angular velocity. At any given moment, it can be written that $m g l=\\\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}+\\\\frac{1}{2} I \\\\omega^{2}-m g l \\\\cos \\\\varphi$. Since $I=\\\\frac{1}{2} m(2 l)^{2}=\\\\frac{1}{3} m l^{2}$, then\\n\\n$$\\nm g l(1+\\\\cos \\\\varphi)=m l^{2} \\\\omega^{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sin ^{2} \\\\varphi+\\\\frac{1}{6}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nOur third equation comes from the fact that the tension on the rod at any moment can be written as $T=m g-m a \\\\Longrightarrow m a=m g-T$. We can finally get a fourth equation by equating torques such that $\\\\frac{1}{3} m l^{2} \\\\varepsilon=T l \\\\sin \\\\varphi$. With these four equations, simple algebra yields the tension at any point is\\n\\n$$\\nT(\\\\varphi)=\\\\frac{1+(3 \\\\cos \\\\varphi-1)^{2}}{\\\\left(1+3 \\\\sin ^{2} \\\\varphi\\\\right)^{2}} m g \\\\Longrightarrow T_{\\\\min } \\\\approx 0.165 m g\\n$$']",

    "answer": "A",
    "solution": "[\"We will work in the reference frame of the center of mass of the cylinder because the fluid flow is steady in this reference frame. The key intuition here is that the magnitude of the fluid velocity above the cylinder will be higher on the top because the tangential velocity of the cylinder is in the same direction as the velocity of the fluid on the top. By Bernoulli's principle, this means that the pressure on the top is lower than the pressure on the bottom, which will create a lift force on the cylinder.\\nWith the given theory, we can model this quantitatively. In our chosen reference frame, the water\\n\\n\\n\\nmoves with velocity $v$ to the left. The velocity potential around a cylinder with radius $R$ is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Phi(r, \\\\theta)=-v r \\\\cos \\\\theta-v \\\\frac{R^{2}}{r} \\\\cos \\\\theta+R^{2} \\\\omega \\\\theta\\n$$\\n\\nTherefore, we find\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\nabla \\\\Phi=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial r} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}+\\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\hat{\\\\theta}=-v\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{R^{2}}{r^{2}}\\\\right) \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}+\\\\left(v\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{R^{2}}{r^{2}}\\\\right) \\\\sin \\\\theta+R \\\\omega\\\\right) \\\\hat{\\\\theta}\\n$$\\n\\nAs expected from boundary conditions, the radial velocity vanishes when $r=R$. Furthermore, on the surface of the cylinder, we have the tangential velocity of the fluid is $2 v \\\\sin \\\\theta+R \\\\omega$ in the counterclockwise direction. Consider points on the cylinder at angles $\\\\theta$ and $-\\\\theta$. By Bernoulli's principle (ignoring the height difference which will be accounted with the buoyant force),\\n\\n$$\\np_{-\\\\theta}-p_{\\\\theta}=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho\\\\left((2 v \\\\sin \\\\theta+R \\\\omega)^{2}-(-2 v \\\\sin \\\\theta+R \\\\omega)^{2}\\\\right)=4 \\\\rho v R \\\\omega \\\\sin \\\\theta\\n$$\\n\\nIf we integrate this result along the surface of the cylinder, we can find the lift force per unit length. Note that only the vertical components of the pressure will matter as the horizontal components cancel due to symmetry. The vertical component of the pressure difference is then $4 \\\\rho v r_{0} \\\\omega \\\\sin ^{2} \\\\theta$. Thus, the lift force per unit length is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{F_{\\\\text {lift }}}{H}=\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\pi} 4 \\\\rho v R \\\\omega \\\\sin ^{2}(\\\\theta)(R d \\\\theta)=2 \\\\pi \\\\rho \\\\omega v R^{2}\\n$$\\n\\nThe total left force is\\n\\n$$\\nF_{\\\\text {lift }}=2 \\\\pi \\\\rho R^{2} H \\\\omega v \\\\text {. }\\n$$\\n\\nThe gravitational force is $M g$, and the buoyant force is $\\\\pi R^{2} H \\\\rho g$.

If it did not, by Faraday's Law, an emf\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{E}=-\\\\frac{d \\\\Phi}{d t}\\n$$\\n\\nwould be generated in the loop. Since superconducting materials have no resistance, this would imply an infinite current, hence a contradiction.\\n\\nWe will first compute the flux through the rectangular loop when there is a current $I_{1}$. Since $w \\\\ll \\\\ell$, we can assume that the vertical segments produce negligible amounts of magnetic field. We can furthermore approximate the field produced by one of the horizontal wires a distance $r$ away as\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I}{2 \\\\pi r}$ (this is valid for an infinitely long wire, and therefore is also valid in the regime where $w \\\\ll \\\\ell$ ).\\n\\nThus, the total flux through the rectangular loop when there is a current $I_{1}$ is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Phi_{1}=\\\\int_{r}^{w} B\\\\left(\\\\ell d r^{\\\\prime}\\\\right)=\\\\int_{r}^{w-r}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{1}}{2 \\\\pi r^{\\\\prime}}+\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{1}}{2 \\\\pi\\\\left(w-r^{\\\\prime}\\\\right)}\\\\right) \\\\ell d r^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{1} \\\\ell}{\\\\pi} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{w}{r}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nNote that the self inductance of the loop is $L=\\\\frac{\\\\Phi}{I_{1}}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell}{\\\\pi} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{w}{r}\\\\right)$.\\n\\nNow, we will determine the flux through the rectangular loop due to the long current-carrying wire. This is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Phi_{2}=\\\\int_{d}^{d+w} \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\\\pi r}(\\\\ell d r)=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2} \\\\ell}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{d+w}{d}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nThe mutual inductance is $M=\\\\frac{\\\\Phi_{2}}{I_{2}}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{d+w}{d}\\\\right)$.

The forces on the vertical sides cancel out because the current in the loop is in opposite directions on these sides. From the horizontal sides, we have the force is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\nF=\\\\sum\\\\left(I_{3} \\\\vec{\\\\ell} \\\\times \\\\vec{B}\\\\right) & =I_{3} \\\\ell\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\\\pi d}-\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\\\pi(d+w)}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\n& =\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell w}{2 \\\\pi d(d+w)}\\\\left[I_{2}\\\\left(I_{1}-\\\\frac{M}{L} I_{2}\\\\right)\\\\right] .\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nThis quadratic in $I_{2}$ is maximized when $I_{2}=\\\\frac{L}{2 M} I_{1}$ in which case the force becomes\\n\\n$$\\nF=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell w}{2 \\\\pi d(d+w)} \\\\frac{L I_{1}^{2}}{4 M}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell w I_{1}^{2}}{4 \\\\pi d(d+w)} \\\\frac{\\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{w}{r}\\\\right)}{\\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{d+w}{d}\\\\right)}\\n$$\\n\\nNote: If the size of the wires is considered when computing flux, a slightly different answer is obtained.

    "response": "To determine the height of the camera above the ground, we need to analyze the perspective of the house in the photograph. The key points to consider are the coordinates of the vertices of the house in the image.\n\nThe coordinates of the vertices of the house in the image are:\n- (0, 0)\n- (0, 3)\n- (22, -3)\n- (22, 10)\n- (26, 0)\n- (26, 3)\n\nFrom these coordinates, we can see that the house is tilted in the image. The height of the house is 3 meters, and the top edge of the house is at y = 3 and the bottom edge is at y = 0. The coordinates (22, -3) and (22, 10) indicate that the top edge of the house is higher than the bottom edge in the image, suggesting that the camera is positioned at a certain height above the ground.\n\nTo find the height of the camera, we can use the concept of similar triangles. The height of the camera above the ground can be determined by the ratio of the heights of the similar triangles formed by the house and its image.\n\nThe height of the house is 3 meters, and the difference in the y-coordinates of the top and bottom edges of the house in the image is 10 - (-3) = 13 units. This means that the camera is positioned such that the height of the house in the image is scaled by a factor of 13/3.\n\nTherefore, the height of the camera above the ground is:\n\\[ \\text{Height of the camera} = \\frac{3 \\times 3}{13} = \\frac{9}{13} \\approx 0.9 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\\boxed{D}",

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the behavior of the light ray as it passes through the system of half-lenses. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the System**:\n   - We have many identical half-lenses with focal length \\( f \\).\n   - The half-lenses are arranged such that they share the same center and are angularly separated equally at a density \\( n \\) (number of lenses per unit radian).\n   - The length scale is defined as \\( \\lambda = \\frac{f}{n} \\).\n\n2. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - A light ray arrives perpendicular to the first lens at a distance \\( \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\) away from the center.\n   - The light ray leaves from the last lens at a distance \\( 2\\lambda \\) away from the center.\n\n3. **Deflection by Each Half-Lens**:\n   - Each half-lens will deflect the light ray by a small angle. For a thin lens, the deflection angle \\( \\theta \\) for a light ray passing at a distance \\( y \\) from the optical axis is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\theta \\approx \\frac{y}{f}\n     \\]\n   - For the first half-lens, the light ray passes at a distance \\( \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\), so the deflection angle is:\n     \\[\n     \\theta_1 \\approx \\frac{\\frac{\\lambda}{2}}{f} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2f} = \\frac{1}{2n}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Cumulative Deflection**:\n   - As the light ray passes through each subsequent half-lens, it will be deflected by a similar small angle. Since there are \\( n \\) half-lenses, the total deflection angle \\( \\Delta \\theta \\) can be approximated by summing up the individual deflections:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta \\theta \\approx n \\times \\frac{1}{2n} = \\frac{1}{2}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Position**:\n   - The light ray starts at \\( \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\) and ends at \\( 2\\lambda \\). The total radial distance covered is:\n     \\[\n     2\\lambda - \\frac{\\lambda}{2} = \\frac{3\\lambda}{2} = \\frac{3f}{2n}\n     \\]\n   - The total deflection angle should account for the change in radial position. Using the small angle approximation, the total deflection angle \\( \\Delta \\theta \\) can be related to the change in radial position:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta \\theta \\approx \\frac{\\frac{3f}{2n}}{f} = \\frac{3}{2n}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Limit as \\( n \\to \\infty \\)**:\n   - In the limit \\( n \\to \\infty \\), the total deflection angle approaches:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta \\theta \\approx \\frac{3}{2} \\approx 1.5 \\text{ rad}\n     \\]\n\nHowever, considering the options provided and the detailed analysis, the closest match is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the energy dissipation and the time it takes for the coin to come to a complete stop. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Potential Energy Calculation:**\n   The initial potential energy of the coin when it is tilted by an angle \\(\\theta\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   U = mgh\n   \\]\n   where \\(h\\) is the height difference between the center of mass of the coin in its initial position and its final position (when it is flat on the surface). For a small angle \\(\\theta\\), the height difference \\(h\\) is approximately \\(r(1 - \\cos\\theta)\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the coin. So,\n   \\[\n   h \\approx r(1 - \\cos\\theta) \\approx r \\cdot \\frac{\\theta^2}{2} \\quad \\text{(for small angles, using the approximation } \\cos\\theta \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2})\n   \\]\n   Given \\(r = 1 \\text{ cm} = 0.01 \\text{ m}\\) and \\(\\theta = 8^\\circ = \\frac{8\\pi}{180} \\approx 0.1396 \\text{ rad}\\),\n   \\[\n   h \\approx 0.01 \\cdot \\frac{(0.1396)^2}{2} \\approx 0.01 \\cdot 0.00954 \\approx 9.54 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the initial potential energy is:\n   \\[\n   U = mgh = mg \\cdot 9.54 \\times 10^{-5}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Energy Dissipation per Collision:**\n   After each collision, the coin loses a fraction of its energy. Specifically, after each collision, the coin retains only \\(k = 0.9\\) of its previous energy. This means that after \\(n\\) collisions, the remaining energy is:\n   \\[\n   E_n = E_0 \\cdot k^n = mg \\cdot 9.54 \\times 10^{-5} \\cdot 0.9^n\n   \\]\n   The coin will come to a complete stop when its remaining energy is negligible. We can set up the condition that the remaining energy is less than a very small value, say \\(E_{\\text{min}}\\):\n   \\[\n   mg \\cdot 9.54 \\times 10^{-5} \\cdot 0.9^n < E_{\\text{min}}\n   \\]\n   Assuming \\(E_{\\text{min}}\\) is very small, we can approximate that the coin stops when the remaining energy is effectively zero. This happens when:\n   \\[\n   0.9^n \\approx 0\n   \\]\n   Taking the natural logarithm on both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   n \\ln(0.9) \\approx -\\infty \\implies n \\approx \\frac{-\\ln(E_{\\text{min}} / (mg \\cdot 9.54 \\times 10^{-5}))}{\\ln(0.9)}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\ln(0.9) \\approx -0.10536\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   n \\approx \\frac{\\ln(1 / (mg \\cdot 9.54 \\times 10^{-5}))}{0.10536}\n   \\]\n   For practical purposes, we can estimate that the coin will stop after about 30 collisions (since \\(0.9^{30} \\approx 0.042\\)).\n\n3. **Time Calculation:**\n   The time between each collision depends on the period of the pendulum-like motion of the coin. The period \\(T\\) of a physical pendulum is given by:\n   \\[\n   T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{I}{mgh}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(I\\) is the moment of inertia of the coin about the pivot point. For a uniform disk pivoted at the edge, \\(I = \\frac{3}{2}mr^2\\). So,\n   \\[\n   T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{3}{2}mr^2}{mgr \\cdot \\frac{\\theta^2}{2}}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{3r}{g\\theta^2}} \\approx 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{3 \\cdot 0.01}{9.8 \\cdot (0.1396)^2}} \\approx 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{0.03}{0.0195}} \\approx 2\\pi \\sqrt{1.54} \\approx 2\\pi \\cdot 1.24 \\approx 7.8 \\text{ s}\n   \\]\n   Since the coin collides approximately every half period, the time between collisions is about \\(3.9 \\text{ s}\\). Therefore, the total time for 30 collisions is:\n   \\[\n   t \\approx 30 \\cdot 3.9 \\approx 117 \\text{ s}\n   \\]\n   However, the closest option to this value is 8.8 seconds, so the answer is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{C}\n   \\]",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the forces acting on the plank:**\n   - The weight of the plank \\( W \\).\n   - The buoyant force \\( F_B \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the weight of the plank:**\n   The weight of the plank is given by:\n   \\[\n   W = \\rho_{\\text{plank}} V g = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot V g = 0.5 \\rho_{\\text{water}} V g\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\rho_{\\text{plank}} \\) is the density of the plank, \\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\) is the density of water, \\( V \\) is the volume of the plank, and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\n3. **Calculate the buoyant force:**\n   The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the submerged part of the plank. The volume of the submerged part of the plank is \\( V_{\\text{sub}} = A \\cdot 0.5 \\sin \\theta \\), where \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area of the plank.\n   \\[\n   F_B = \\rho_{\\text{water}} V_{\\text{sub}} g = \\rho_{\\text{water}} A \\cdot 0.5 \\sin \\theta \\cdot g\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set up the torque equation:**\n   For the plank to be in equilibrium, the net torque about the hinge must be zero. The torque due to the weight of the plank acts at the center of mass of the plank, which is at a distance of \\( 0.5 \\) meters from the hinge. The torque due to the buoyant force acts at the centroid of the submerged part of the plank, which is at a distance of \\( \\frac{0.5 \\sin \\theta}{2} \\) from the hinge.\n   \\[\n   W \\cdot 0.5 \\cos \\theta = F_B \\cdot \\frac{0.5 \\sin \\theta}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the expressions for \\( W \\) and \\( F_B \\):\n   \\[\n   0.5 \\rho_{\\text{water}} V g \\cdot 0.5 \\cos \\theta = \\rho_{\\text{water}} A \\cdot 0.5 \\sin \\theta \\cdot g \\cdot \\frac{0.5 \\sin \\theta}{2}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   0.25 \\rho_{\\text{water}} V g \\cos \\theta = 0.125 \\rho_{\\text{water}} A g \\sin^2 \\theta\n   \\]\n   Since \\( V = A \\cdot 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   0.25 \\cos \\theta = 0.125 \\sin^2 \\theta\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2 \\cos \\theta = \\sin^2 \\theta\n   \\]\n   Using the identity \\( \\sin^2 \\theta = 1 - \\cos^2 \\theta \\):\n   \\[\n   2 \\cos \\theta = 1 - \\cos^2 \\theta\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives a quadratic equation in \\( \\cos \\theta \\):\n   \\[\n   \\cos^2 \\theta + 2 \\cos \\theta - 1 = 0\n   \\]\n   Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\( \\cos \\theta = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\cos \\theta = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( \\cos \\theta \\) must be between -1 and 1, we take the positive root:\n   \\[\n   \\cos \\theta = \\sqrt{2} - 1\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\( \\theta = \\cos^{-1}(\\sqrt{2} - 1) \\approx 65.5^\\circ \\).

    "solution": "['Let us analyse, what would be the change of the magnetic energy when one of the straws is displaced to a small distance. The magnetic field inside the tubes will remain constant due to the conservation of magnetic flux, but outside, the magnetic field will be changed. The magnetic field outside the straws is defined by the following condition: there is no circulation of $\\\\vec{B}$ (because there are no currents outside the straws); there are no sources of the field lines, other than the endpoints of the straws; each of the endpoints of the straws is a source of streamlines with a fixed magnetic flux $\\\\pm \\\\Phi$. These are exactly the same condition as those which define the electric field of four charges $\\\\pm Q$. We know that if the distance between charges is much larger than the geometrical size of a charge, the charges can be considered as point charges (the electric field near the charges remains almost constant, so that the respective contribution to the change of the overall electric field energy is negligible). Therefore we can conclude that the endpoints of the straws can be considered as magnetic point charges. In order to calculate the force between two magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles), we need to establish the correspondence between magnetic and electric quantities.\\n\\nFor two electric charges $Q$ separated by a distance $a$, the force is $F=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{2}}$, and at the position of one charge, the electric field of the other charge has energy density $w=\\\\frac{1}{32 \\\\pi^{2} \\\\varepsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{4}}$; hence we can write $F=8 \\\\pi w a^{2}$. This is a universal expression for the force (for the case when the field lines have the same shape as in the case of two opposite and equal by modulus electric charges) relying only on the energy density, and not related to the nature of the field; so we can apply it to the magnetic\\n\\n\\n\\nfield. Indeed, the force can be calculated as a derivative of the full field energy with respect to a virtual displacement of a field line source (electric or magnetic charge); if the energy densities of two fields are respectively equal at one point, they are equal everywhere, and so are equal the full field energies. As it follows from the Gauss law, for a point source of a fixed magnetic flux $\\\\Phi$ at a distance $a$, the induction $B=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\Phi}{a^{2}}$.

The way we set it up here is the simplest, since it makes the integral easy. (For most students, the hardest part was finding a compact expression for $L$. A common mistake was assuming $L=m v_{x} r$ or a variant thereof.)\"\n \"The net effect on the disk of one ant going in the circular path is the same as two ants going along the path, each with half the mass, and thus the same as four ants each with a quarter the mass, and so on. By repeating this logic, we can thus replace the ant with a ring of radius $r$ and mass $m$ of uniform density, which rotates around once.

This kind of phenomenon occurs in many fields of physics, and is generally known as a geometric phase.\"\n 'We can decompose the circle into a stack of thin rectangles. The effect of a single ant going around the circle is the same as the effect of one ant going around each rectangle. But by slightly generalizing your result in part (a), you can show that the net rotation due to each rectangle is $(4 m / M)\\\\left(d A / R^{2}\\\\right)$ where $d A$ is the area of that rectangle. Summing the areas gives the answer. Like the third solution, this works for any ant trajectory, and it makes it clear why it was the area of the trajectory that mattered.']",

    "response": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into manageable steps.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe need to find the maximum angle \\(\\alpha_{\\text{max}}\\) at which the mass can be launched such that it can still hit the cylinder. The mass is launched with kinetic energy \\(K\\) at an angle \\(\\alpha\\) away from the direction of the spring's displacement.\n\n### Step 2: Energy Considerations\nThe initial kinetic energy of the mass is given by:\n\\[ K = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is the initial speed of the mass.\n\n### Step 3: Motion Analysis\nWhen the mass is launched at an angle \\(\\alpha\\), it will have both horizontal and vertical components of velocity. The horizontal component of the velocity will help the mass move towards the cylinder, while the vertical component will affect its height.\n\n### Step 4: Horizontal Distance Calculation\nThe horizontal distance \\(d\\) the mass needs to cover to hit the cylinder is approximately \\(R \\theta_0\\). The horizontal component of the initial velocity is \\(v \\cos \\alpha\\). The time \\(t\\) taken to cover this distance is:\n\\[ d = v \\cos \\alpha \\cdot t \\]\n\\[ R \\theta_0 = v \\cos \\alpha \\cdot t \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{R \\theta_0}{v \\cos \\alpha} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Vertical Motion\nThe vertical component of the initial velocity is \\(v \\sin \\alpha\\). The vertical displacement \\(y\\) after time \\(t\\) is given by:\n\\[ y = v \\sin \\alpha \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\nSubstituting \\(t = \\frac{R \\theta_0}{v \\cos \\alpha}\\):\n\\[ y = v \\sin \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{R \\theta_0}{v \\cos \\alpha} - \\frac{1}{2} g \\left( \\frac{R \\theta_0}{v \\cos \\alpha} \\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ y = R \\theta_0 \\tan \\alpha - \\frac{1}{2} g \\frac{(R \\theta_0)^2}{v^2 \\cos^2 \\alpha} \\]\nFor the mass to hit the cylinder, the vertical displacement \\(y\\) should be equal to the height difference between the launch point and the cylinder, which is approximately \\(R (1 - \\cos \\theta_0)\\).\n\n### Step 6: Setting Up the Equation\n\\[ R (1 - \\cos \\theta_0) = R \\theta_0 \\tan \\alpha - \\frac{1}{2} g \\frac{(R \\theta_0)^2}{v^2 \\cos^2 \\alpha} \\]\nUsing \\(v^2 = \\frac{2K}{m}\\):\n\\[ R (1 - \\cos \\theta_0) = R \\theta_0 \\tan \\alpha - \\frac{1}{2} g \\frac{(R \\theta_0)^2 m}{2K \\cos^2 \\alpha} \\]\n\\[ R (1 - \\cos \\theta_0) = R \\theta_0 \\tan \\alpha - \\frac{g R^2 \\theta_0^2 m}{4K \\cos^2 \\alpha} \\]\nSolving for \\(\\alpha\\):\n\\[ \\alpha_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{r}{R \\sin \\theta_0} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{m g R (1 - \\cos \\theta_0) - \\frac{1}{2} m g R \\theta_0 \\sin \\theta_0}{K}} \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",

In this figure points $A$ and $A^{\\\\prime}, B$ and $B^{\\\\prime}, P$ and $P^{\\\\prime}$ are\\n\\n\\n\\nequivalent, respectively. Let us introduce a Cartesian coordinate system on this unfolded plane so that point $O$ is the origin, axis $z$ is parallel with the axis of cylinder and directed downwards, axis $x$ is perpendicular to $z$ (i.e. horizontal).\\n\\n<img_4470>\\n\\nFig. 2\\n\\nConsider the forces acting on a small piece of the thread (with horizontal projection $\\\\Delta x$ ) indicated with red line in both figures. These are the tensions at both ends of the small piece exerted by neighbouring parts of the thread, the normal force $\\\\Delta N$ and the friction force $\\\\Delta f$ exerted by the cylinder. On the verge of slipping, the direction of $\\\\Delta f$ is parallel to the $z$-axis. Since the small piece of thread is in equilibrium, the $x$-component of the tension is the same everywhere:\\n\\n$$\\nT_{x}=\\\\text { const. }\\n$$\\n\\nThe normal force $\\\\Delta N$ can be determined by looking at the top view of the loop in Fig. 1. The polar angle corresponding to small piece of thread is $\\\\Delta \\\\varphi=\\\\Delta x / R$, so the force balance in the radial direction can be written as\\n\\n$$\\n2 T_{x} \\\\underbrace{\\\\sin \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\varphi}{2}}_{\\\\approx \\\\Delta \\\\varphi / 2}-\\\\Delta N=0 \\\\quad \\\\longrightarrow \\\\quad \\\\Delta N=T_{x} \\\\frac{\\\\Delta x}{R} .\\n\\\\tag{4}\\n$$\\n\\nThe frictional force on the verge of slipping is given by\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Delta f=\\\\mu \\\\Delta N\\n\\\\tag{5}\\n$$\\n\\nThus, the force balance on the small piece of thread in the $z$ direction (see Fig. 2):\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left.T_{x} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} z}{\\\\mathrm{~d} x}\\\\right|_{x+\\\\Delta x}-\\\\left.T_{x} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} z}{\\\\mathrm{~d} x}\\\\right|_{x}-\\\\Delta f=0\\n\\\\tag{6}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere we expressed the $z$-component of the tension forces with $T_{x}$ and the tangent $\\\\mathrm{d} z / \\\\mathrm{d} x$.

In the limit $\\\\mu \\\\rightarrow 0$ the loop slips even if $L=2 \\\\pi R$, which should be reproduced by our final formula.

This involves analyzing the forces acting on the thread and the role of friction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - A thread is tied into a loop of length \\( L \\) and placed around a cylinder of radius \\( R \\).\n   - The coefficient of friction between the thread and the cylinder is \\( \\mu \\).\n   - The free end of the thread is pulled parallel to the axis of the cylinder.\n   - We need to find the critical length \\( L_0 \\) such that if \\( L > L_0 \\), the loop can slide along the cylinder without changing its shape.\n\n2. **Forces Acting on the Thread:**\n   - When the thread is pulled, there are two main forces to consider: the tension in the thread and the frictional force between the thread and the cylinder.\n   - The tension in the thread is distributed along the length of the thread, and the frictional force acts tangentially to the cylinder.\n\n3. **Critical Length Calculation:**\n   - For the loop to slide without changing its shape, the total frictional force must be sufficient to counteract the tension in the thread.\n   - The frictional force \\( F_f \\) is given by \\( F_f = \\mu N \\), where \\( N \\) is the normal force.\n   - The normal force \\( N \\) is the component of the tension perpendicular to the surface of the cylinder.\n\n4. **Using the Capstan Equation:**\n   - The capstan equation relates the tension in the thread before and after it wraps around an object:\n     \\[\n     T_2 = T_1 e^{\\mu \\theta}\n     \\]\n     where \\( T_1 \\) and \\( T_2 \\) are the tensions on either side of the wrap, and \\( \\theta \\) is the angle of wrap in radians.\n\n5. **Angle of Wrap:**\n   - The angle of wrap \\( \\theta \\) is related to the length of the thread \\( L \\) and the circumference of the cylinder \\( 2\\pi R \\):\n     \\[\n     \\theta = \\frac{L}{R}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Equilibrium Condition:**\n   - For the loop to slide, the tension difference must be balanced by the frictional force:\n     \\[\n     T_2 - T_1 = \\mu N\n     \\]\n     Substituting \\( T_2 = T_1 e^{\\mu \\theta} \\):\n     \\[\n     T_1 e^{\\mu \\theta} - T_1 = \\mu N\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     T_1 (e^{\\mu \\theta} - 1) = \\mu N\n     \\]\n\n7. **Critical Length \\( L_0 \\):**\n   - For the loop to slide, the angle of wrap \\( \\theta \\) must be such that the frictional force is sufficient:\n     \\[\n     \\theta = \\frac{L_0}{R} = 2\\pi\n     \\]\n     Therefore:\n     \\[\n     L_0 = 2\\pi R\n     \\]\n\nThus, the critical length \\( L_0 \\) is \\( 2\\pi R \\).\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\).",

Consider a point $Q$ on the end of the thread being pulled that coincided with $P$ at the moment when it touched the cylinder. Consider motion of the thread in a system of reference (SR), which rotates at angular speed $\\\\omega=u / R$ around the center of the cylinder. In that SR the part of the thread in contact with the cylinder is at rest and the point $Q$ rotates around the cylinder with the angular velocity $\\\\omega_{Q}=-\\\\omega$ (see the figure).\\nSince the middle part of the thread is at rest, energy of the mass $P$ is conserved. For the same reason, the velocity $v_{P}$ of $P$ is perpendicular to the thread. Therefore the kinetic energy acquired by the mass in the rotating frame is equal to the decrease of its centrifugal potential energy:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{2} m v_{P}^{2}=-\\\\frac{1}{2} m \\\\omega^{2} R^{2}+\\\\frac{1}{2} m \\\\omega^{2} r^{2}=\\\\frac{1}{2} m \\\\omega^{2} l_{P}^{2}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $l_{P}$ is the length of the unwound part of the thread on the side of the mass $P$ (see the figure).

    "solution": "['When you look at the photo of the lens and/or the graph provided, four regions with different brightness levels can be distinguished. The brightest region represents the magnified image of the blur spot created by the lamp through the lens. The blur spot is created because the distance from the lens to the white sheet beneath it is slightly larger than the focal distance; as we can see from the graph, the blur spot is of almost constant brightness (a flat plateau at $\\\\log _{10} I=4.4$ ), so we can say that the entire luminous flux falling from the lamp onto the lens is distributed evenly over the blur spot. Note that the blur spot has no sharp edges, though, as you would expect from in such case. This is because the image of this bright disc is situated between the lens and the camera, and is at a fairly big distance away from the plane which is sharp at the image sensor (as seen from the photo, the camera is focused onto the lens). Because of that, the enlarged image of the blur spot has blurred edges in the photo (at the blurred edges, $\\\\log _{10} I$ varies from 3.4 to 4.4). The second-brightest region (with $\\\\log _{10} I=3.4$ ) represents the scattered light from the brightest region: in that region, we are still looking through the lens, and see the area next to the bright blur spot on the sheet. Ideally, its should be darker than the sheet seen in those places where it is not obstructed by the lens, because the lens is shading the light from the lamp. However, the glass elements of this big lens are non-ideal (and there are many glass elements inside the lens!), so the light from the lamp and the bright blur spot is scattered towards the camera giving rise to an increased apparent brightness. In the area where we see the blur spot, this light is insignificant (much weaker than the light from the blur spot), but not so in this dark area: here, the scatteredfrom-the-glass-surfaces dominates heavily over the light coming from the paper sheet. As a matter of fact, this fact could be used to improve the accuracy of the calculations: we could subtract the contribution of the scattered light $\\\\left(10^{3.4}\\\\right)$ from the total intensity of the light at the brightest spot $\\\\left(10^{4.4}\\\\right)$ to obtain the contribution coming from the blur spot on the sheet. The darkest regions (with $\\\\log _{10} I<1.75$ ) represent the interior black painting of the lens seen through the big front glass element of the lens, which absorbs most of the incident light, and the region with $x>420$ and $\\\\log _{10} I=1.95$ represents the white sheet illuminated by the lamp. The ratio between the measured light intensity of the brightest region and that of the region with $x>420$ can be utilized to find the distance of the sheet (the blur spot) from the lens to the paper sheet $d_{0}$, see below.\\n\\nFrom the data given in the problem text we know that $L \\\\gg f$; from the photo of the lens, it is also clear that $d_{0}$ is of the same order of magnitude as $f$. Because of that, the illuminance $E$ (luminous flux per unit area) near the lens can be assumed to be the same as at the paper sheet, The luminous flux per solid angle and unit area of a lightscattering (or radiating) surface is called the luminance $\\\\mathscr{L}$; since all these directions under which the scattered light enters the lens aperture are close to the surface nor$\\\\mathrm{mal}$, we may assume the luminance of the paper sheet to be constant over all these directions. With the small\\n\\n\\n\\nangle approximation, the light intensity $I$ (illuminance, luminous flux $\\\\Phi$ per unit area) at the camera sensor is proportional to $\\\\mathscr{L}$ (see Explanation 1).\\n\\nThe luminance of the blur spot on the sheet $\\\\mathscr{L}_{B S}$ is $1 / k$ larger than the luminance $\\\\mathscr{L}_{s}$ of the paper sheet, where $k$ equals the ratio between the area of the bright dot (the blur spot) on the paper sheet and the area of the lens, because all the light received by the lens is \"compressed\" into the tiny blur spot.\\n\\nSmall angle approximation is also used to show that luminance of the image of the blur spot $\\\\mathscr{L}_{I}$ equals to the luminance of the blur spot $\\\\mathscr{L}_{B S}$ (see Explanation 2). Therefore, the light intensity at the sensor cells corresponding to the brightest area (where we see the image of the blur spot) $I_{I}=I_{s} / k$, where $I_{s}$ stands for the intensity at the cells corresponding to unobscured paper sheet. So, from the graph, we can deduce the value of $k$, and knowing $k$ we can calculate $d_{0}$. Let the distance along the axis between the image of the bright region through the lens and the lens itself be denoted as $d_{S}$; according to the Newton\\'s lens formula, $\\\\left(d_{S}-f\\\\right)\\\\left(d_{0}-f\\\\right)=$ $f^{2}$. Hence,\\n\\n$$\\nd_{S}=f+\\\\frac{f^{2}}{d_{0}-f}=\\\\frac{d_{0} f}{\\\\left(d_{0}-f\\\\right)}\\n$$\\n\\ncan be also determined.\\n\\nHypothesize that $d_{0}-f \\\\ll f$. Let us calculate the diameter of the image of the blur spot\\n\\n$$\\nD_{I}=\\\\frac{D_{B S} d_{S}}{d_{0}}=\\\\frac{D_{B S} f}{d_{0}-f}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere the diameter of the blur spot on the sheet\\n\\n$$\\nD_{B S}=\\\\frac{D\\\\left(d_{0}-f-s\\\\right)}{f+s} \\\\approx \\\\frac{D\\\\left(d_{0}-f-s\\\\right)}{f}\\n$$\\n\\nand $s$ denotes the distance of the image of the point source from the focal plane. Using Newton\\'s lens formula, $s=f^{2} /\\\\left(L-f-d_{0}\\\\right) \\\\approx f^{2} / L$, This leads us to\\n\\n$$\\nD_{B S} \\\\approx D\\\\left(\\\\frac{d_{0}-f}{f}-\\\\frac{f}{L}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nand therefore\\n\\n$$\\nD_{I} \\\\approx D\\\\left[1-\\\\frac{f^{2}}{L\\\\left(d_{0}-f\\\\right)}\\\\right]\\n$$\\n\\nKeeping in mind that $d_{0}-f=\\\\frac{d_{0} f}{d_{S}} \\\\approx \\\\frac{f^{2}}{d_{S}}$, we obtain\\n\\n$$\\nD_{I} \\\\approx D\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{d_{S}}{L}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{D\\\\left(L-d_{S}\\\\right)}{L} .\\n$$\\n\\nThis means that as seen from the position of the camera, the angular size of the image of the blur spot $\\\\theta_{B S}=$ $D_{I} /\\\\left(L-d_{S}\\\\right)$ equals to the angular size of the lens aperture $\\\\theta_{L}=D / L$. This fact is easily confirmed from the photo and is an important observation for two reasons. First, it means that based on the angular diameter of the image of the blur spot on the photo, it is impossible to figure out the distance $d_{0}$ (and hence, $d_{S}$ ). Second, it allows us to measure instead of the angular distance $\\\\theta$ between the centre of the lens and the centre of the image of the blur spot (as seen from the position of the cameraline), the respective distance between the edges of the respective circles. Equality of these two angular sizes is also easily seen from the geometric construction, see the figure. Ineed, consider blue lines $S A G$ and $S B F$ which arrive from the lamp $S$ to the edges of the blur spot. Image of point $F$, denoted by $J$, is now easily found as the intersection point of the ray $S B F$ with the ray $F O$ (passing through the centre of the lens); image $H$ of the other edge of the blur spot is found in the same way. From this construction, it becomes clear that the angular size of the image of the blur spot and the lens, as seen from the camera, are exactly equal, without any approximation. Due to the smallness of the distance $h$, these angular sizes remain almost constant when the observation point is moved from $S$ to $C$.\\n\\nGiven the images are approximately circular, the area ratio $k$ equals $\\\\left(D_{B S} / D\\\\right)^{2}$, or\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\pm \\\\sqrt{k}=\\\\frac{1}{f}\\\\left(d_{0}-\\\\frac{L f}{L-f}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{d_{0}}{f}-\\\\frac{L}{L-f}\\n$$\\n\\nIn the above equation, the \\\\pm sign represents the two cases where the paper sheet is behind or in front of the image of the lamp. From the graph, the ratio between the intensity of the brightest region and the dark region with $x>420$ is $10^{4.4-1.95} \\\\approx 282$, which equals $1 / k$. Then, $d_{0} / f$ can be found to be $\\\\pm \\\\sqrt{k}+1+f / L$, which gives two solutions $d_{0} / f \\\\approx 1.07$ and $d_{0} / f \\\\approx 0.95$. According to the experimental settings given in the problem text, $d_{0}$ is greater than $f$, and thus we obtain $d_{0} / f \\\\approx 1.07$ and $d_{S} \\\\approx 15.03 f \\\\approx 83 \\\\mathrm{~cm}$. This also verifies the hypothesis that $d_{0}-f \\\\ll f$.\\n\\nThe centre of the image of the blur spot is positioned at the height $h^{\\\\prime}=h \\\\frac{d_{S}}{L}$ above the direction to the centre of the lens (this expression from similarity of the triangles $O Q P$ and $O C S$ ) which means that $\\\\theta=h^{\\\\prime} /\\\\left(L-d_{S}\\\\right)$; meanwhile, the angular diameter of the lens $\\\\theta_{L}=D / L$. Therefore,\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{\\\\theta_{L}}=\\\\frac{h d_{S}}{D\\\\left(L-d_{S}\\\\right)}\\n$$\\n\\nThe ratio of the angular distances is easily measured from the figure as the ratio of the width $d_{c r}$ of the crescent-shaped second-brightest region to the diameter of the lense\\'s aperture $D^{\\\\prime}$ :\\n\\n$$\\nh=\\\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\\\prime}} \\\\frac{D\\\\left(L-d_{S}\\\\right)}{d_{S}}\\n$$\\n\\nBased on the graph, $d_{c r} \\\\approx 90$ pixels (midpoint of the blurry edge is around $x \\\\approx 120 \\\\mathrm{px}$, and the left edge of the aperture (in the graph) is at $x \\\\approx 30 \\\\mathrm{px}$; the right edge of the lens aperture is at $x \\\\approx 240 \\\\mathrm{px}$ corresponding to $D^{\\\\prime}=210 \\\\mathrm{px}$ and yielding $h \\\\approx 80 \\\\mathrm{~mm}$.\\n\\nRemark 1. In order to obtain the final answer with a reasonably good accuracy, it is not strictly speaking necessary to show that the apparent angular diameters of the lens and of the image of the blur spot are equal. All the other calculations remain the same, just one needs to match a circle with the circular segment of the visible edge of the blur spot, and measure directly $h^{\\\\prime}$, the distance between the centre of the lens and the centre of the blur spot, together with the diameter of the lens aperture $D^{\\\\prime}$ (see the small figure).\\n\\nRemark 2. The width of the crescent-shaped secondbrightest area can be also measured from the photo of\\n\\n\\n\\nthe lens with the required accuracy; however, measuring in pixels from the graph is more accurate.\\n\\nExplanation 1: Consider a small light source of luminance $\\\\mathcal{L}$ and surface area $S$ at a large distance $\\\\uparrow$ from the camera. The illuminance (the luminous flux per unit area) at the position of the camera is proportional to $\\\\uparrow^{-2}$ and so is the total luminous flux received by the whole sensor. Meanwhile, all this light energy is focused onto a small area $S^{\\\\prime}$ on the sensor - onto the image of the light source, and this area is also proportional to $\\\\uparrow^{-2}$. Therefore, the illuminance $I$ at the position of those sensor pixels which are covered by the image is independent of the distance $\\\\uparrow$.\\n\\nExplanation 2: Consider a very narrow cone of light of solid angle $\\\\omega$, starting from a very small area $S$ at the blur spot in a direction close to the surface normal, and carrying a total luminous flux $\\\\Phi$. Since the cone is narrow, this light beam is entirely caught by the lens at distance $d_{0}$, and focused onto the image of surface area $S^{\\\\prime}=S\\\\left(d_{S} / d_{0}\\\\right)^{2}$ at distance $d_{S}$ from the lens. The light rays of this beam traverse the focus and form another light cone of solid angle $\\\\omega^{\\\\prime}$ departing from the image. It is easy to see from similar triangles that $\\\\omega / \\\\omega^{\\\\prime}=\\\\left(d_{S} / d_{0}\\\\right)^{2}$. Then, the luminance of the image $\\\\mathcal{L}_{I}=\\\\Phi /\\\\left(S^{\\\\prime} \\\\omega^{\\\\prime}\\\\right)=\\\\Phi /(S \\\\omega)$, i.e. equal to the luminance of the blur spot.\\n\\n<img_4504>\\n\\n<img_4511>\\n\\nRemark 3: After having derived Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 and calculated $d_{0}$, the geometrical optics aspect can also be tackled by considering the image of the camera through the lens. The region bounded by the darkest ring in the image represents the area on the paper sheet that is observable by the camera through the lens. This area can be approximated by a circular spot with diameter $d$ (represented by $D^{\\\\prime}$ in the graph) depending negligibly on the size of the lens of the camera. Given small angles and that the lamp and the camera have equal distances to the lens, the bright spot on the paper sheet also has a diameter of $d$, which means $d=D \\\\sqrt{k}$. The angular distance between the lamp and the camera as seen from the center of the lens is $h /\\\\left(L-d_{0}\\\\right)$, and therefore, the distances between the two spots\\' centers, and also thus their boundaries (represented by $d_{c r}$ in the graph), on the paper sheet are $d_{0} h /\\\\left(L-d_{0}\\\\right)$. We then obtain an equivalent equation to that above:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{d_{0} h /\\\\left(L-d_{0}\\\\right)}{D \\\\sqrt{k}}=\\\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\\\prime}} \\\\Leftrightarrow h=\\\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\\\prime}} D \\\\sqrt{k} \\\\frac{L-d_{0}}{d_{0}} \\\\approx 80 \\\\mathrm{~mm} .\\n$$\\n\\nIt should be noted that, compared to the original analysis, the deviation in this calculation caused by $f / L$ (in finding $d_{0}$ and $d_{S}$ ) on the final result reduces drastically (from approximately $20 \\\\%$ down to approximately $1 \\\\%$ ). Even if $d_{0} \\\\approx f$ is assumed, the result is only deviated by approximately $7 \\\\%$.']",

Since the insect is moving with a constant speed \\( v \\) along the rod, the only force acting on it is the centripetal force due to the rotation of the rod.\n\n2. **Position Vector and Centripetal Force**:\n   The position vector \\( \\vec{r} \\) of the insect at time \\( t \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{r} = vt \\hat{r}\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\hat{r} \\) is the unit vector along the rod.

The electric field vectors at O due to these charges will have components along the x-axis and y-axis. Since the geometry is symmetric, the y-components will cancel out, and only the x-components will add up.\n\nThe electric field at O due to the charge at A:\n\\[ E_A = \\frac{k \\frac{q}{3}}{R^2} \\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{k \\frac{q}{3}}{R^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{kq}{6R^2} \\]\n\nThe electric field at O due to the charge at B:\n\\[ E_B = \\frac{k \\frac{q}{3}}{R^2} \\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{k \\frac{q}{3}}{R^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{kq}{6R^2} \\]\n\nThe electric field at O due to the charge at C:\n\\[ E_C = \\frac{k \\left(-\\frac{2q}{3}\\right)}{R^2} \\cos(0^\\circ) = \\frac{k \\left(-\\frac{2q}{3}\\right)}{R^2} \\cdot 1 = -\\frac{2kq}{3R^2} \\]\n\nAdding these components:\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{kq}{6R^2} + \\frac{kq}{6R^2} - \\frac{2kq}{3R^2} = \\frac{kq}{3R^2} - \\frac{2kq}{3R^2} = -\\frac{kq}{3R^2} = -\\frac{q}{12\\pi\\epsilon_0R^2} \\]\n\nSo, the electric field at point O is \\(\\frac{q}{12\\pi\\epsilon_0R^2}\\) directed along the negative x-axis.

Therefore, \\( \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\).\n\n   So the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   y(x, t) = 10 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{25} x - \\frac{2\\pi}{5} t + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the velocity of point \\( P \\):**\n   The velocity \\( v_y \\) of a point on the string is given by the partial derivative of \\( y \\) with respect to \\( t \\):\n   \\[\n   v_y = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial t} = 10 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{25} x - \\frac{2\\pi}{5} t + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   v_y = -4\\pi \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{25} x - \\frac{2\\pi}{5} t + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the position of point \\( P \\) when its displacement is 5 cm:**\n   When \\( y = 5 \\) cm, we have:\n   \\[\n   5 = 10 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{25} x - \\frac{2\\pi}{5} t + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{25} x - \\frac{2\\pi}{5} t + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\pi}{25} x - \\frac{2\\pi}{5} t + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{\\pi}{25} x - \\frac{2\\pi}{5} t + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}\n   \\]\n   Solving for the first case:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\pi}{25} x - \\frac{2\\pi}{5} t + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\pi}{25} x - \\frac{2\\pi}{5} t = \\frac{\\pi}{6} - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = -\\frac{\\pi}{3}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{25} - \\frac{2t}{5} = -\\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3x - 30t = -25\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 10t - \\frac{25}{3}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Substitute \\( x \\) back into the velocity equation:**\n   \\[\n   v_y = -4\\pi \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = -4\\pi \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = -2\\pi\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n   Converting to meters per second:\n   \\[\n   v_y = -\\frac{2\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{100} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}\\pi}{50} \\text{ m/s}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the velocity of point \\( P \\) when its displacement is 5 cm is \\(\\boxed{B}\\).",

    "response": "To determine the correct representation of the sound intensity of the whistle as observed by the passengers in train A, we need to consider the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect describes how the frequency of a wave changes for an observer moving relative to the source of the wave.\n\nIn this scenario, the whistle is stationary, and the train A is moving towards the whistle. As the train approaches the whistle, the passengers on the train will observe an increase in the frequency of the sound due to the Doppler effect.

The initial kinetic energy of the object (both translational and rotational) will be converted into potential energy at the maximum height.\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the object is the sum of its translational kinetic energy and its rotational kinetic energy. For a rolling object, the total kinetic energy \\( K \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the object, \\( v \\) is the linear velocity, \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia about the axis of rotation, and \\( \\omega \\) is the angular velocity. Since the object is rolling without slipping, we have \\( \\omega = \\frac{v}{R} \\), where \\( R \\) is the radius of the object.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of the final image formed by the combination of the convex lens and the convex spherical mirror. We will do this step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the image formed by the convex lens\nThe object is placed 50 cm to the left of the convex lens with a focal length of 30 cm. Using the lens formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{u}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( f = 30 \\) cm, \\( u = -50 \\) cm (since the object is to the left of the lens), and \\( v \\) is the image distance. Plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{-50}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{50}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{1}{v}\n\\]\n\nFinding a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5 + 3}{150} = \\frac{8}{150} = \\frac{4}{75}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{75}{4} = 18.75 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nThe image formed by the lens is 18.75 cm to the right of the lens. This image will act as the object for the convex mirror.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the image formed by the convex mirror\nThe convex mirror is placed 50 cm to the right of the lens, so the object distance for the mirror is:\n\n\\[\nu' = 50 - 18.75 = 31.25 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nThe radius of curvature of the mirror is 100 cm, so the focal length \\( f' \\) is:\n\n\\[\nf' = \\frac{R}{2} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nUsing the mirror formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f'} = \\frac{1}{v'} + \\frac{1}{u'}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{1}{v'} + \\frac{1}{31.25}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{50} - \\frac{1}{31.25} = \\frac{1}{v'}\n\\]\n\nFinding a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{31.25 - 50}{1562.5} = \\frac{-18.75}{1562.5} = \\frac{-3}{250}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nv' = -\\frac{250}{3} \\approx -83.33 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nThis negative value indicates that the image is virtual and formed behind the mirror. The image is 83.33 cm to the left of the mirror, which is:\n\n\\[\n50 - 83.33 = -33.33 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nfrom the lens.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the coordinates of the final image\nThe mirror is tilted at an angle of 30\u00b0. The image formed by the mirror will be at a distance of 83.33 cm along the line making an angle of 30\u00b0 with the horizontal. The coordinates of the image can be found using trigonometry:\n\n\\[\nx = 50 - 83.33 \\cos(30^\\circ) = 50 - 83.33 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 50 - 71.67 = -21.67 \\approx -25\\sqrt{3}/2\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = -83.33 \\sin(30^\\circ) = -83.33 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = -41.67 \\approx -25\n\\]\n\nSo the coordinates are approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\left(50 - 25\\sqrt{3}, 25\\right)\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{B}",

The direction of the induced current is such that it opposes the change in magnetic flux (Lenz's law).\n\nIn this case, the magnetic field is increasing in the direction going into the plane of the figure. Therefore, the induced current will flow in a direction that creates a magnetic field out of the plane of the figure to oppose the increase in the inward magnetic field.\n\n### Step 2: Apply Lenz's law to the entire loop\nThe entire loop will have an induced current that flows in a counterclockwise direction when viewed from above. This means:\n- Current \\(I_1\\) in segment ab will flow from b to a.\n- Current \\(I_2\\) in segment cd will flow from d to c.\n\nSo, \\(I_1\\) is in the direction ba and \\(I_2\\) is in the direction dc. This eliminates options A, B, and D, leaving us with option C.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the relative magnitudes of the currents\nThe magnitude of the induced current depends on the resistance of the segments. Since the segments ab and cd are part of the same loop and the magnetic field is uniform, the induced emf in both segments will be the same. However, the current will be inversely proportional to the resistance of the segments.\n\nIf we assume the resistances of the segments are equal, then the currents \\(I_1\\) and \\(I_2\\) will be equal. But since the problem does not provide information about the resistances, we can only conclude the directions of the currents.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]",

This means that any net charge will reside on the surface of the conductor.\n   - When a point charge \\( +q \\) is placed inside an uncharged conducting shell, the shell will induce a charge distribution on its inner and outer surfaces to ensure that the electric field inside the conductor remains zero.\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Statement:**\n\n   **A: The electric field just above the surface of the conductor is 0.**\n   - This statement is false. The electric field just above the surface of a conductor is not zero. It is perpendicular to the surface and has a magnitude given by \\( E = \\sigma / \\epsilon_0 \\), where \\( \\sigma \\) is the surface charge density.\n\n   **B: There are no charges located on the interior of the conducting surface.**\n   - This statement is false. Since the point charge \\( +q \\) is inside the shell, it will induce a charge \\( -q \\) on the inner surface of the shell to cancel out the electric field due to \\( +q \\) inside the conductor. Therefore, there is a charge \\( -q \\) on the inner surface.\n\n   **C: The electric field between the charge and the conducting shell is 0.**\n   - This statement is false. The electric field between the charge \\( +q \\) and the inner surface of the shell is not zero.

The potential difference depends on the specific geometry and the distance from the charge to the shell.\n\n   **E: The electric flux through the asymmetric shell is \\( \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0} \\).**\n   - This statement is true.

The electric field inside a uniformly charged sphere is given by:\n\\[ E = \\frac{kQr}{R^3} \\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the distance from the center of the sphere and \\( R \\) is the radius of the sphere. Therefore, there is an electric field inside the non-conducting sphere. So, statement A is true.\n\n**Statement B: There is an electric field in the space between the sphere and the shell.**\n\nThe electric field in the space between the sphere and the shell can be calculated using Gauss's law. For a Gaussian surface that lies between the sphere and the shell, the enclosed charge is \\( +Q \\), so the electric field is:\n\\[ E = \\frac{kQ}{r^2} \\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the distance from the center of the sphere. Therefore, there is an electric field in the space between the sphere and the shell. So, statement B is true.\n\n**Statement C: There is an electric field above the outer surface of the conducting shell.**\n\nSince the conducting shell has no net charge, the total charge on the outer surface of the shell must be \\( -Q \\) to cancel out the charge \\( +Q \\) on the inner surface of the shell. The electric field outside the conducting shell is due to the net charge \\( +Q \\) (from the sphere) and \\( -Q \\) (from the outer surface of the shell), which results in a net electric field of zero. Therefore, there is no electric field above the outer surface of the conducting shell. So, statement C is false.\n\n**Statement D: All points in the conducting shell are at the same electric potential.**\n\nIn a conductor, the electric field inside the conductor is zero, and all points in the conductor are at the same electric potential. This is a fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. So, statement D is true.\n\n**Statement E: All points in the non-conducting sphere are at the same potential.**\n\nThe potential inside a uniformly charged non-conducting sphere is not constant. The potential at a distance \\( r \\) from the center of the sphere is given by:\n\\[ V = \\frac{kQ}{2R} \\left( 3 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2} \\right) \\]\nwhere \\( R \\) is the radius of the sphere.

Your palm should point in the direction of the force (\\( -\\hat{j} \\)).\n\nIf we want the force to be in the negative-\\( y \\) direction, we need to find the direction of the magnetic field such that when we cross the velocity vector with the magnetic field vector, we get the negative-\\( y \\) direction.\n\nBy trying different directions:\n- If the magnetic field is in the \\( +z \\) direction (\\( \\hat{k} \\)), then:\n  \\[ (-\\hat{i}) \\times (\\hat{k}) = -\\hat{j} \\]\n  This gives us the correct direction for the force on a positively charged particle, so for an electron, the force will be in the positive-\\( y \\) direction.\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field must be in the \\( +z \\) direction.\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\).",

The goal is to find a point where the torque due to the unknown force (the tension in the rope) can be isolated and solved for easily.\n\nLet's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the forces acting on the rod:**\n   - The weight of the rod, \\( W \\), acts at the center of mass of the rod.\n   - The tension in the rope, \\( T \\), acts at point 1.\n   - The normal force from the wall, \\( N \\), acts at point 2.\n\n2. **Choose a point to calculate the torques:**\n   - If we choose point 1, the torque due to the tension \\( T \\) will be zero because the line of action of \\( T \\) passes through point 1. However, the torques due to the weight \\( W \\) and the normal force \\( N \\) will still be present, making the equation more complex.\n   - If we choose point 2, the torque due to the normal force \\( N \\) will be zero because the line of action of \\( N \\) passes through point 2. However, the torques due to the weight \\( W \\) and the tension \\( T \\) will still be present, making the equation more complex.\n   - If we choose point 3, the torque due to the normal force \\( N \\) will be zero because the line of action of \\( N \\) passes through point 2, and the torque due to the weight \\( W \\) will be simplified because it acts at a known distance from point 3. The torque due to the tension \\( T \\) will also be simplified because it acts at a known distance from point 3. This makes the equation easier to solve for \\( T \\).\n   - If we choose point 4, the torque due to the normal force \\( N \\) will be zero because the line of action of \\( N \\) passes through point 2, and the torque due to the weight \\( W \\) will be simplified because it acts at a known distance from point 4. The torque due to the tension \\( T \\) will also be simplified because it acts at a known distance from point 4. This makes the equation easier to solve for \\( T \\).\n\nSince points 3 and 4 both simplify the torque equation for the tension \\( T \\), and point 3 is closer to the center of the rod, it is generally preferred for simplicity.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is \\(\\boxed{C}\\).",

Let's denote this potential difference as \\( V_{parallel} \\).\n\n5. **Relate the Potential Differences:**\n   - The current through the 20 \u03a9 resistor is the same as the current through the parallel combination.\n   - The potential difference across the 20 \u03a9 resistor is \\( V_{20} = I \\times 20 \\, \\Omega \\).\n   - The potential difference across the parallel combination is \\( V_{parallel} = I \\times 10 \\, \\Omega \\).\n\n6. **Compare the Potential Differences:**\n   - The potential difference across the 15 \u03a9 resistor is \\( V_{15} = V_{parallel} \\).\n   - The potential difference across the 30 \u03a9 resistor is also \\( V_{30} = V_{parallel} \\).\n\nTherefore, the potential difference across the 15 \u03a9 resistor is equal to the potential difference across the 30 \u03a9 resistor.\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\).",
